# 🔍 Deployment Monitoring - Active

**Triggered:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** 🔄 **DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS**

## 📊 **Deployment Status**

### **Trigger Details**
- **Method:** Empty commit push
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Monitor URL:** https://github.com/aisaiah-ai/aethercorp/actions

### **Expected Workflow Steps**

1. ✅ **Checkout code**
2. ✅ **Setup Flutter 3.27.0**
3. ✅ **Install dependencies** (`flutter pub get`)
4. ✅ **Run Flutter analyze** (with `--no-fatal-infos`)
5. ✅ **Build Flutter web app** (should succeed)
6. ⚠️ **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages** (may fail if token not updated)

## 🔍 **What to Watch For**

### **Build Phase (Should Succeed)** ✅
```bash
# Expected success output:
Compiling lib/main.dart for the Web...
✓ Built build/web
✅ Build successful - index.html found
```

### **Deploy Phase (Watch for Token Error)** ⚠️

**If Token NOT Updated:**
```
✘ [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/memberships) failed.
Authentication error [code: 10000]
```

**If Token IS Updated:**
```
🌍  Uploading... (X/Y files)
✨  Success! Uploaded X files
✨  Deployment complete! 
```

## 📋 **Monitoring Checklist**

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow started
- [ ] Checkout step completed
- [ ] Flutter setup completed
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Analyze step passed
- [ ] Build step succeeded
- [ ] Deploy step status (pending token update)

## ⚠️ **Known Issue**

**Cloudflare API Token Permissions**

The deployment **WILL FAIL** at the deploy step unless the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` has been updated with these permissions:
- Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit
- Account → Account Settings → Read
- User → User Details → Read

### **To Fix Before Deploy Succeeds:**

1. Create new token: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Update GitHub secret: https://github.com/aisaiah-ai/aethercorp/settings/secrets/actions
3. Re-trigger deployment

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **Code Status**
- ✅ All code changes committed
- ✅ Workflow configuration correct
- ✅ Local build verified working
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ Compatible with Flutter 3.27.0

### **Infrastructure Status**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Wrangler command syntax correct
- ⚠️ API token needs permission update

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Scenario 1: Token Already Updated**
If you've already updated the Cloudflare API token:
- ✅ Deployment should complete successfully
- ✅ Site will be live at your Cloudflare Pages URL

### **Scenario 2: Token NOT Updated**
If token hasn't been updated yet:
1. Wait for this deployment to fail at deploy step
2. Update the token (see CLOUDFLARE-TOKEN-FIX.md)
3. Trigger another deployment
